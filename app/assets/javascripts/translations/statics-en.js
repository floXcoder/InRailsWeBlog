You create an account by providing us with an email address and creating a password. We refer to this as your “Basic Subscriber Information”. We encourage you to use a distinct and non-obvious password that is different from passwords you use for any other service. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy, completeness and confidentiality of your Basic Subscriber Information, and you will be responsible for all activities that occur under your account, including activities of others to whom you have provided your Basic Subscriber Information. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to provide us with accurate information or to keep your Basic Subscriber Information secure. If you discover any unauthorized use of your Basic Subscriber Information or suspect that anyone may be able to access your private Content without authorization, you should immediately change your password and notify our Customer Support team.","content_2":"Second, you will need to access your account through a web browser, tablets and phones.

The Website also has no responsibility for the availability of the Internet and other telecommunication services necessary to access the Service."},"share":{"title":"Can I Share My Account with Someone Else?","content_1":"The Website accounts should not be shared.

We will not have any liability to you (or anyone you share your Basic Subscriber Information with) as a result of your or their actions under those circumstances. Since we provide a number of mechanisms to allow you to share your account Content with others, we strongly urge you not to share your information with anyone, unless you are doing so as part of your estate planning purposes, as discussed below."},"rights":{"title":"Once I Have an Account, What Are My Rights in the Website Service?","content_1":"Once your account is created and you accept these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive license to use the Service subject to these Terms, for so long as you are not barred from receiving the Service under the laws applicable to you, until you close your account voluntarily or until we close your account pursuant to these Terms.

Other than this limited license and other rights you grant in these Terms, the Website acknowledges and agrees that we do not obtain any right, title or interest from you under these Terms in any of your Content."},"license":{"title":"What Is the License I Have to Grant to the Website?","content_1":"In order to enable the Website to operate the Service, we must obtain from you certain limited license rights to process your Content that is covered by intellectual property rights so that technical actions we take in operating the Service are not considered legal violations. For example, copyright laws could prevent us from processing, maintaining, storing, backing-up and distributing certain Content, unless you give us these rights. Accordingly, by using the Service and uploading Content, you are granting to the Website a license to display, perform and distribute your Content and to modify (for technical purposes, e.g., making sure content is viewable on smartphones as well as computers and other devices) and reproduce such Content to enable the Website to operate the Service.

If the third party service or application you elect to use would access or extract Content, you grant to the Website the right and license to enable third party access to and extraction of your Content. The Website does not assume any responsibility for, or liability on account of, the actions or omissions of such third party applications or service providers. As we rely upon your rights to upload and distribute your Content, you represent and warrant to the Website that (1) you have the unfettered legal rights and authority to submit your Content to the Website, to make any other use, publication or other distribution of that Content in your use of the Service, and to grant the rights granted to the Website under these Terms; and (2) your Content complies with our User Guidelines and these Terms.","content_4":"Finally, you understand and agree that the Website, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Service to our users, may make such changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to the technical requirements of connecting networks, devices, services or media."},"insurance":{"title":"What Other Assurances Do I Have to Grant to the Website?","content_1":"When you use the Website service to send messages to an email address, to a telephone number via SMS, or through a social media account (e.g., Facebook or LinkedIn) that has not been linked to the Website account, the Website sends such messages on your behalf, and we are relying on your representation to us that you have a direct relationship with the recipient(s) and that you are respecting the legal rights of the recipient(s) not to receive certain kinds of messages (such as harassing messages, unsolicited commercial messages, and unwanted SMS messages).

We expect that any such modifications will enhance the overall Service, but it is possible that you may not agree with us. We also reserve the right to establish limits to the nature or size of storage available to you, the number of transmissions, the ability to send or receive email messages, the nature or size of any index or library information, the nature of, or your continued ability to access or distribute, your Content and other data, and impose other limitations at any time, with or without notice. You also acknowledge that a variety of the Website actions may impair or prevent you from accessing your Content or using the Service at certain times and/or in the same way, for limited periods or permanently, and agree that the Website has no responsibility or liability as a result of any such actions or results, including, without limitation, for the deletion of, or failure to make available to you, any Content.

If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been violated, please notify our Compliance team according to the instructions provided by our IP Rights Compliance Program and we will investigate. Note that each owner of intellectual property is responsible for protecting their rights and taking any legal or other action they determine to be appropriate to do so, and the Website does not accept any obligation to take any particular action to enforce or protect any party’s intellectual property rights on their behalf."},"storage":{"title":"Where Does My Data Go?","content_1":"The Service is available worldwide, but your data is stored in France, as described in our Privacy Policy. If you use the Service, you acknowledge that you may be sending electronic communications (including your Basic Subscriber Information and Content), through computer networks owned by the Website, its Service Providers, and other third parties located in other countries.
